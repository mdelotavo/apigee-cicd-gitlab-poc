# Default API proxies

This directory contains the default API proxies that are provided with every 
organization on Apigee Edge. If you create an account on Apigee Edge, and 
then you log in to the Edge management UI, you will see these two API 
proxies in your organization.

They are:

* **helloworld** -- A simple API proxy that sends requests to Apigee's `http://mocktarget.apigee.net` sample target, which returns a variety of sample responses. The API proxy includes a Quota policy and an Assign Message policy that provides CORS support.
* **oauth** -- An OAuth endpoint for generating access tokens with the client credentials grant type. 

We provide them here for convenience. If you need to reset to 'factory settings' you can simply deploy the API proxies provided here.
