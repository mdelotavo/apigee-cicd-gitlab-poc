# OpenAPI spec for the helloworld sample

`mocktarget.yaml` is an [OpenAPI specification](https://openapis.org/) for Apigee's mock RESTful target service, located at http://mocktarget.apigee.net (more information about the service [here](https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/default-proxies/helloworld)).

With `mocktarget`, you can generate interactive SmartDocs API documentation for the mock target service in your Edge developer portal just like you would any OpenAPI spec you created yourself. In fact, we used `mocktarget.yaml` to generate SmartDocs on the [Apigee documentation site](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/mock-target-api) for you to try out.

For more information on how to generate SmartDocs with an OpenAPI spec, see [Using SmartDocs to document APIs](http://docs.apigee.com/developer-services/content/using-smartdocs-document-apis) in the Apigee docs.
