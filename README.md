# Apigee CI/CD GitLab Proof of Concept

**Please note that this project was created as a temporary experiment and is no longer actively maintained.**

This repository contains a proof of concept for deploying an API proxy to Apigee Edge using GitLab CI/CD and the "apigeetool" command-line tool. The pipeline is configured to deploy the proxy to the "test" environment in Apigee Edge and is triggered manually.

While this project was useful as a proof of concept, it should not be used as a starting point for new projects or as an example of best practices. It is being archived for reference purposes only.

If you're interested in learning more about deploying API proxies to Apigee Edge using GitLab CI/CD, we recommend checking out the official documentation and resources provided by Apigee.
